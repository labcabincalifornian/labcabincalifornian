      <p>i can attribute much of my recent creative work to my experience as a dancer. the breaking (breakdance) community had fostered an unforgivingly raw environment where individualism, innovation, artistic freedom and truly creative ideas were not only encouraged but imperative when trying to progress. it’s a community that i’m still proud to be a part of. however, over the past year or so, i’ve become much more interested in trying to create both musical and visual art as i’ve never fully explored them before. much of my current inspiration stems from the work of web designers, electronic music producers, architects, data visualizers and artists who create things that don't necessarily abide by the fictional “rules” that people feel so obligated to follow. in many ways, i find myself becoming inspired by things that are not meant to exist as art at all but do so anyways. only recognizing and appreciating things as art if they're labeled as such is mundane.</p>

      <p>additionally, choosing to enroll in more asynchronous college courses has pushed me to change and adapt to a more isolated mindset and environment, one that's void of a lot of social contact. while it has affected me in both positive and negative ways, working in seclusion has allowed me to develop a more idiosyncratic way of operating, free from the pressure to always contextualize or verbalize my intentions. my creative output nowadays is primarily a result of this.</p> <!-- Added an empty paragraph for user to fill in content -->

      <p>i don't really find satisfaction in calling myself an artist. i tend to follow the idea that anything can be art and anyone can create it. i also believe that art isn't inherently skillful. recently, i've become more concerned with the initial feeling i get when observing art rather than judging it purely based off of how well-crafted it is. i'm simply someone who enjoys making things and whether the results are "good" or "bad" no longer concerns me as much anymore.</p>
