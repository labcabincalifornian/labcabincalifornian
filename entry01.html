      <p>through attending college, thoroughly defining my long-term goals has become increasingly more important to me. since my adolescence, i was certain that i longed for a life centered around art and design, it was just a matter of finding out what that really meant. as much as i admired the idea of attending art school, it became apparent to me that i wanted balance. much of the reason why i love art is due to the process of creating it. i find that i enjoy engaging in the technical aspects of design more than anything. learning software as well as how to build and personalize websites, exploring different mediums and solving problems are all things i find true fulfillment in doing regardless of recognition or other arbitrary motives. i’ve been able to narrow my general interests in the field of design down to more distinctive ones such as architectural studies. i find it fascinating that professional architects can effectively combine the more systematic aspects of engineering design with their own artistic intuition to manifest something both useful and meaningful. learning the concept of having to simultaneously act as a salesman, designer and engineer deeply inspired me as it felt both foreign and complex. it quickly brought to my attention that something so logical and straightforward could actually be incredibly artistic and abstract. this concept is also what largely inspired the creation of this website and its contents.</p>

      <p>i can attribute much of my recent creative work to my experience as a dancer. the breaking (breakdance) community had fostered an unforgivingly raw environment where individualism, innovation, artistic freedom and truly creative ideas were not only encouraged but imperative when trying to progress. it’s a community that i’m still proud to be a part of. however, over the past year or so, i’ve become much more interested in trying to create both musical and visual art as i’ve never fully explored them before. much of my current inspiration stems from web designers, electronic music producers, architects, data visualizers and art that doesn’t necessarily abide by the fictional “rules” that many artists feel so obligated to follow. in many ways, i find myself becoming inspired by things that are not meant to exist as art at all but do so anyways. only recognizing and appreciating things as art if they're labeled as such is mundane.</p>

      <p>additionally, choosing to enroll in more asynchronous college courses has pushed me to change and adapt to a more isolated mindset and environment, one that's void of a lot of social contact. while it has affected me in both positive and negative ways, working in seclusion has allowed me to develop a more idiosyncratic way of operating, free from the pressure to always contextualize or verbalize my intentions. my creative output nowadays is primarily a result of this.</p> <!-- Added an empty paragraph for user to fill in content -->

      <p>i don't really find satisfaction in calling myself an artist. i tend to follow the idea that anything can be art and anyone can create it. i also believe that art isn't inherently skillful. recently, i've become more concerned with the initial feeling i get when observing art rather than judging it purely based off of how well-crafted it is. i'm simply someone who enjoys making things and whether the results are "good" or "bad" no longer concerns me as much anymore.</p>
